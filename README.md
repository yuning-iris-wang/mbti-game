# mbti-game
This is a MBTI testing game. It is my first project in HTML/CSS/Javascript. The collaborators are Miaoyan Zou, Zhiyuan Li, and Yeying Guo. When the player makes a choice in the game and completes the ending, the player's MBTI attributes will be detected and the player will eventually learn what their MBTI is.
